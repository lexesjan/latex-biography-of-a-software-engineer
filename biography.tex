\section{Introduction}
Kenneth Lane Thompson, also known as Ken Thompson, was born on the 4th of
February 1943 in New Orleans, Loiusiana, U.S. During Thompson's childhood, he
was always facinated with logic and electronics. Thompson got his first
exposure with programming during his junior semester year in lab classes
where they had a G15 computer. Thompson created scaling programs on the G15
computer which was written in assembly. \cite{seibel2009coders}

Thompson attended the University of California, Berkley, graduating with a
Bachelor of Science in 1965 and a Master's degree in Electrial Engineering and
Computer Science in 1966. Following this, Thompson was then hired at Bell
Laboratories. It was here where many of his well known accomplishments were
created, notably UNIX, along with Dennis Ritchie, the B programming language and
the UTF-8 character encoding. \cite{linfo}
